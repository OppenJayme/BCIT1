Create a program that uses structures to store information about employees (name, ID, position, salary, and hours worked). 
Name the structure "Employee". The program should allow the user to enter information about employees, calculate their pay 
based on their salary and hours worked, and display the total payroll for the company. The program should also allow the user to search for employees 
by ID and delete an employee.
